  <h1>Ruby Tidbits!</h1>
  <h3 style="color: darkred">Built with Ruby on Rails by Shujaat Azim</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome! I created this no-frills Ruby on Rails project because I'd encountered/created many interesting little methods during my time learning 
    to code that I wanted to preserve them in one place.
  </p>
  <p>
    I called these little functions "tidbits," hence the project's name. Plus, it was a good excuse to try and make a standalone Rails app for practice! 
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you enjoy the tidbits, and maybe even learn a bit about them from their associated explanations!
  </p>
